This was my first foray into developing a mobile app with React Native. I learned a number of things during the course of this project, including:
- how to use the React hooks `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useRef`;
- how to structure stacks and screens using React Navigation;
- how to use AsyncStorage to persist app state when closing and re-opening the app; and
- how to set up icons and splash screens for Android and iOS.

The inspiration behind this app was James Hoffmann's AeroPress Dice, which you can see a video of [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHdXC_88_2g). James is an amazing resource for those of us with just a little too much interest in coffee. If you're of similar inclination, you owe it to yourself to check out some of his videos.
