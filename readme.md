## CoffeeRandomizer

Brew time, coffee and water amount, coarseness of grind. All of these affect the resulting flavor of your coffee. This app generates random coffee recipes for your AeroPress based off the different adjustable brewing factors.

## About

This was my first foray into developing a mobile app with React Native. I learned a number of things during the course of this project, including:
- how to use the React hooks `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useRef`;
- how to structure stacks and screens using React Navigation;
- how to use AsyncStorage to persist app state when closing and re-opening the app; and
- how to set up icons and splash screens for Android and iOS.

The inspiration behind this app was James Hoffmann's AeroPress Dice, which you can see a video of [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHdXC_88_2g). James is an amazing resource for those of us with just a little too much interest in coffee. If you're of similar inclination, you owe it to yourself to check out some of his videos.
